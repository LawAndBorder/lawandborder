# Law and Border

## Primary Goals of this Project
- Deliver Time Series models and a complete project by the end of the day
- Predict the number of crossings by method by port for next year

## Minimum Viable Product
- End to end analysis including:
    - Exploration and model border crossings by crossing method by port to predict future crossings. 
    - Time series analysis of crossings by method by port

## Project Planning First Steps
- Pull in the data from https://data.transportation.gov/Research-and-Statistics/Border-Crossing-Entry-Data/keg4-3bc2/data
- Define our goals of analysis
- Define what each observation (each row) contains
- Define what kinds of models we can or should produce.

## Need to haves
- Reproduceable acquire and prepare Python scripts
- Testable hypotheses
- Exploratory data analysis 
- Time Series Analysis with a model for each 

## Nice to Haves (if we have time)
- Multivariate Time Series Analysis Model
- Maggies Method for Time Series Anomaly Detection and "doing time series without the time"

## Thoughts
- Each observation (each) creates its own time series model

## Data Acquisition
split by country so we have a Canada and Mexico dataset
split by crossing method

## Data Preparation

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Cluster by crossing_type and number of crossings `n_crossings`.
